Physical layer: wired and wireless
ethernet port/ rj(reserved jack)-45 port
serial port-rs 232
Cables: they passes the  electrical signals  in the form of 0 and 1
types:
	UTP-unshielded twisted pair(it doesn't have layer protection)
	STP-shielded twisted pair.(it has the double layer protection)

Any cable has 4 pairs of wires(green ,orange ,blue, brown)

âžœStraight cable: A to A or B to B( for different devices)ex: computer connect to the switch
âžœCross cable: A to B or B to A( for same devices)ex: computer to computer

ðŸž‰Hub and end devices are layer1/physical layer device.
hub is a broad casting device and half duplex device

ðŸž‰switch are layer2/datalink layer device
switch is a unicasting device and full duplex device
Layer2 contains the mac address.

Fast ethernet- 10/100 mbps
gigabit ethernet- 1gbps, 2gbps, ....

Icmp(Internet Control Message Protocol)-unicasting
Arp(address resolution protocol)-broadcasting-It gets the mac address of the destination device.
â˜…Arp maps the Ip and mac address and vice versa by executing broadcasting.
â˜…switch creates the mac address table and executes unicasting.

âž½Switches are two types:
	Unmanaged switches(un configurable)
	Managed switches(configurable) 
âž½Switch has 3 modes:
	âž»user execution mode(>)

To go to privileged execution mode: command-enable
	âž»privileged execution mode(#)
	To monitor the configuration: command-show ip interface brief

To go to global configure terminal mode: configure terminal
	âž»configure terminal(config #)
	To change the switch name: command-hostname <switch name>
        For go to the port: command- interface fastEthernet <port.no>(ex: interface fastEthernet 0/1)
				     âž» shutdown(for disable)
                                     âž»no shutdown(for enable it again)
        For go to no.of ports within a range: interface range fastEthernet <port range>(ex: interface range fastEthernet 0/1-10)
âž½For setting the password to console:
	1.line console 0
	2.password <password name>
	3.login
	4.enable password <password name>
*exit from all the modes-if we want to go to the any mode ,it will ask the password*
âž»To permanently save the configuration:
	In second mode(#):copy running-config startup-config
âž»To show the running configuration : show running-config
âž»Password encryption: service password-encryption
